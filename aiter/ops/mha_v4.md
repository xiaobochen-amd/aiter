# MHA V4 Entrypoint And FMHA V4 Engine

## Current Status

Dense BF16-output MHA v4 is implemented and validated on gfx950. A gfx942 signed INT8/FP8 row is
also preserved under v4.

The public raw and packed APIs support six dense combinations:

| Q/K | V | Output |
|---|---|---|
| INT8 | FP8 | BF16 |
| FP8 | FP8 | BF16 |
| MXFP6 E2M3 | FP8 | BF16 |
| MXFP4 E2M1 | FP8 | BF16 |
| MXFP6 E2M3 | MXFP4 E2M1 | BF16 |
| MXFP4 E2M1 | MXFP4 E2M1 | BF16 |

Current scope is batched, dense, non-causal MHA with matching Q/KV head counts, BF16 raw inputs,
head dimension 128, and BF16 output. It is inference-only: no backward, dropout, RNG state, LSE,
GQA, varlen, or sparse metadata. Unsupported requests fail explicitly and never fall back to
`aiter.ops.mha`.

## Stable Decisions And Ownership

- `aiter.ops.mha_v4` owns mixed-precision preprocessing, packed-layout reconstruction, format and
    scale validation, and the raw/packed Python APIs. `aiter.ops.mha` and `fmha_v3_fwd` retain their
    generic ownership.
- `fmha_v4_fwd` is the internal JIT, launcher, manifest, and HSA family. V4 identifies an extensible
    dispatch and ABI generation, not a universal replacement for v3.
- Dispatch is explicit in Q/K/V formats and scale modes. Tensor dtype, packed width, stride, and
    storage size validate a selected row; they never select one.
- Format IDs are stable and distinguish encodings and integer signedness. `FP6_E2M3` is the active
    FP6 encoding (`MXFP6` alias); `FP6_E3M2` is reserved. Scale granularity remains a separate
    `AttentionScaleMode`, allowing MXFP8 or NVFP4-style recipes without inventing value formats.
- Q, K, and V preprocessing remain separate custom ops for distributed overlap. Exotic layouts
    cross custom-op boundaries as contiguous raw buffers and are rebuilt by MHA v4 view helpers in
    the final launch boundary.
- The public name is not Sage-branded because the supported combinations do not map exactly to one
    SageAttention version.
- Preserve `Optional[T]` annotations in entrypoints and fake implementations. `T | None` caused a
    measured Inductor regression in end-to-end model execution.

The current implementation is intentionally one module, `aiter/ops/mha_v4.py`; a speculative
subpackage split is not part of the design. It exports:

- `mha_v4` and `mha_v4_packed`;
- `AttentionFormat`, `AttentionScaleMode`, `native_fp8_format`, and `scale_modes_for_formats`;
- canonical per-tensor, MX Q/K, and V quantizers;
- `mxfp4_k_view`, `mxfp6_k_view`, and `mxfp4_v_view` for raw-buffer reconstruction;
- `mha_v4_q_multiplier` for the MX Q scaling recipe.

## Authoritative References

- Benchmark integration: `op_tests/op_benchmarks/triton/bench_sage.py`.

## Validated Baseline

Dense extraction, dedicated dispatch, six raw preprocessing paths, packed launch, benchmark
migration, and distributed integration are complete. Callers can delegate quantization, MX Q
scaling, scale recipes, and packed views to MHA v4 while retaining separate Q/K/V custom ops for
communication overlap.

Validation includes eager accuracy for all six combinations, fullgraph eager/compiled parity,
finite outputs, allocator churn with downstream consumers, explicit code-object dispatch,
unaligned and unequal sequence lengths, retained model captures, and balanced multi-GPU target-shape
benchmarks. Focused coverage lives in `op_tests/test_mha_v4.py`.

Still deferred:

- sparse ragged-LUT execution, VSA/Sparge compatibility, and ring/LSE support;
- low-precision output with an explicit data/scale ABI;
- approximate BF16 input under a distinct identity from v3 BF16;
- GQA, causal, varlen, other head dimensions, and more Q/K/V/O combinations;
- broader gfx942, CDNA5, and RDNA manifest/code-object coverage.

## Current Dense Performance

Current gfx950 long-sequence dense ASM kernel throughput, excluding Q/K/V preprocessing:

| Q/K format | V format | Throughput (TFLOP/s) |
|---|---|---:|
| INT8 | FP8 | 2315 |
| FP8 | FP8 | 3050 |
| MXFP6 | FP8 | 3450 |
| MXFP6 | MXFP4 | 3700 |
| MXFP4 | FP8 | 3695 |
| MXFP4 | MXFP4 | 4000 |

These values are the current optimization baselines, not portable performance guarantees. Attach
the exact benchmark shape, harness revision, GPU count, and code-object hashes when promoting them
to release-facing documentation.

## Public API Levels

MHA v4 exposes raw and packed levels. Direct code-object launch remains private.

### Raw QKV API

This is the default application API:

```python
output = mha_v4(
    query,
    key,
    value,
    q_format=AttentionFormat.MXFP6,
    k_format=AttentionFormat.MXFP6,
    v_format=native_fp8_format(),
    softmax_scale=None,
    return_lse=False,
    out=None,
)
```

Inputs are contiguous BF16 BSHD tensors. The requested formats select canonical per-operand
preprocessing and an explicit ASM row; unsupported combinations fail. Q/K must currently match.
Output is BF16, and a supplied `out` must match Q's shape/device. Q, K, and V preprocessing remain
separate custom ops so distributed schedulers can overlap each with its input communication.

### Packed Expert API

This API supports benchmarks, distributed integrations, preprocessing reuse, and callers that
already own packed operands:

```python
output = mha_v4_packed(
    q=packed_query,
    k=packed_key,
    v=packed_value,
    q_descale=q_scale,
    k_descale=k_scale,
    v_descale=v_scale,
    q_format=AttentionFormat.MXFP6,
    k_format=AttentionFormat.MXFP6,
    v_format=native_fp8_format(),
    q_scale_mode=AttentionScaleMode.E8M0_PER_1X32,
    k_scale_mode=AttentionScaleMode.E8M0_PER_1X32,
    v_scale_mode=AttentionScaleMode.F32_PER_CHANNEL,
    softmax_scale=1.0,
    return_lse=False,
    out=None,
)
```

The packed API takes each operand's data, descale, format, and scale mode explicitly. It validates
the complete recipe plus dtype, shape, and layout before launching. Call
`scale_modes_for_formats()` for the production recipe rather than duplicating mode triples.

MX Q/K/V producers return contiguous raw buffers where the ASM layout is not an ordinary tensor
layout. `mxfp4_k_view`, `mxfp6_k_view`, and `mxfp4_v_view` reconstruct logical views. Raw buffers,
not exotic strided views, cross custom-op boundaries; final launch ops rebuild the views.

### MXFP4 V Contract

The F4F4 and F6F4 rows use true MXFP4 V: E2M1 values with one E8M0 scale for every
`(channel, 32-token)` block. `quantize_v_mxfp4` fuses amax, ceil-power-of-two scale generation,
normalization, E2M1 encoding, and the final col-major ASM layout. It returns a contiguous raw FP4
buffer plus a uint8 scale image shaped `[batch, heads, ceil(sequence / 128) * 512]`; ragged loads
are masked and the 64-byte launch slack is zero. The scale image is already in ASM gather order,
not generic row-major metadata. Packed launch uses `E8M0_PER_1X32`; FP8 V uses
`F32_PER_CHANNEL`.

One single-warp Triton program owns each `(32-token, 32-channel)` block, eliminating overlapping
writers. The deployed trailing-underscore F4F4/F6F4 kernels load V scales at QK exit so softmax
hides their VMEM latency, retain 95 SGPR and 256 VGPR, and use 66,048 and 43,008 bytes LDS
respectively. F4F4 keeps next-K0 prefetch under the penultimate PV MFMA; F6F4 keeps split-FP6 K0
prefetch at the PV tail because earlier placement was flat in balanced eight-GPU testing.

Any producer dtype, shape, or layout change requires a versioned custom-op name. Promotion requires
byte equality against the independent Torch payload/scale reference at sequences
`1, 127, 128, 129, 257`, deterministic output, zero slack, eager/fullgraph parity, allocator churn,
focused coverage, and repeated retained model captures. At
`b=1,hq=hk=5,sq=sk=65536,d=dv=128`, final eight-GPU e2e medians were
`3574.8 TFLOP/s` for F4F4 versus `3459.0` for F4F8, and `3351.2 TFLOP/s` for F6F4 versus
`3205.1` for F6F8. The deployed code-object SHA256 values are
`212981592d1e4801f93db1cb8cc37db1ed7335e3fdadf53c0d01e7bd53917d72` (F4F4) and
`a5046f1dcc0d51033122310efab70796e690086391285b9e5cdeaa5496d292a9` (F6F4).

### MXFP6 K Contract

MXFP6 K preprocessing fuses hd128 Hadamard rotation, E2M3 quantization, and final ASM-order packing
in one HIP launch. Each 128-token/head tile contains 12,288 data bytes, a 4,096-byte reserved
region, and a 1,024-byte scale tail. Partial tiles are zero-filled, and the public custom op returns
contiguous raw data and scale buffers so compiled callers never carry the exotic logical view.

Changes to this path require byte equality against `reorder_fp6_k_lds_order_triton` for compact
data, scale tails, and valid scale bytes at aligned and ragged sequence lengths. Keep the raw-buffer
custom-op ABI unchanged unless the op name is versioned with the layout.

## Formats And Scales

Format and scale granularity are separate concepts:

```python
class AttentionFormat(IntEnum):
    FP32 = 0
    FP16 = 1
    BF16 = 2
    FP8_E4M3 = 3
    FP8_E4M3_FNUZ = 4
    FP8_E5M2 = 5
    FP8_E5M2_FNUZ = 6
    FP6_E2M3 = 7
    FP6_E3M2 = 8
    FP4_E2M1 = 9
    INT8 = 10
    UINT8 = 11
    INT4 = 12
    UINT4 = 13


class AttentionScaleMode(IntEnum):
    NONE = 0
    F32_PER_TENSOR = 1
    F32_PER_HEAD = 2
    F32_PER_TOKEN = 3
    F32_PER_CHANNEL = 4
    E8M0_PER_1X32 = 5
```

An FP8, FP6, FP4, or INT8 format does not imply a scale mode. The manifest explicitly records the
scale mode and scale storage format for Q, K, V, and O. This permits future kernels to reuse the
same number format with different quantization granularities without changing the public enum.

The raw API chooses the production recipe through `scale_modes_for_formats`; the packed API requires
that exact recipe explicitly. Add configurable scale modes only when multiple kernels support the
same Q/K/V formats.

## Output Contract

The API returns a BF16 tensor. If `out` is supplied, the kernel writes and returns that same tensor.
Low-precision output will require an explicit data/scale ownership contract and a versioned ABI;
do not add an output record before a kernel and downstream consumer require it.

`return_lse=False` is reserved in both APIs; `True` currently fails clearly. Once supported, use:

```python
output = mha_v4(..., return_lse=False)
output, lse = mha_v4(..., return_lse=True)
```

LSE must be contiguous FP32 `[batch, query_heads, query_length]`, representing the natural-log
log-sum-exp of the selected kernel's scaled logits. Use a versioned or dedicated LSE custom op so
compiled output arity remains stable; do not add dropout or RNG outputs.

## Explicit Kernel Dispatch

The host launcher receives an explicit, compile-time-specializable key containing at least:

```text
architecture
q_format
q_scale_mode
k_format
k_scale_mode
v_format
v_scale_mode
output_format
output_scale_mode
head_dim_qk
head_dim_v
mask_mode
sparse_mode
sequence_mode
layout
bf16_conversion
```

Tensor dtype, shape, stride, and storage size validate the selected row. They never select it.
Unsupported Q/K/V/O combinations fail at manifest lookup with the requested key in the error.

Manifest rows also own:

```text
query_tile
kv_tile
workgroup_size
kernarg_abi
kernel_symbol
code_object
```

Kernel cache identity is `(kernel_symbol, code_object)`, never the symbol alone.

The approximate BF16 kernel uses a distinct symbol, code-object slot, and manifest row, for example
`fwd_hd128_bf16_approx.co`. It must not overwrite or reuse generic `fwd_hd128_bf16.co` dispatch.

## Sparse Contract

Sparse support is deferred. The proposed common descriptor is:

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class AttentionBlockSparseLut:
    kv_block_indices: torch.Tensor
    lut_start: torch.Tensor
    lut_count: torch.Tensor
    query_block_size: int = 256
    kv_block_size: int = 128
```

The tensors are contiguous device `int32`; start/count have one entry per
`(batch, query_head, query_block)`. LUT creation must avoid data-dependent allocations. Sparse
selection is an explicit manifest dimension and ABI, never an inference from extra pointers or a
silent redirect from a dense request.

### VSA Compatibility

AITER VSA supplies delta-encoded fixed-capacity rows plus counts at 128-query-token granularity;
the proposed MHA v4 descriptor uses flat absolute indices and explicit start/count. Encoding
conversion is cheap, but geometry is not: current 256x128 ASM workgroups share one KV list across
two 128-row halves, while adjacent VSA rows may differ. Exact support therefore follows:

1. Directly use an existing 256x128 sparse kernel when adjacent 128-query VSA rows are identical or
    when the policy natively emits 256-query rows.
2. Add a manifest-selected 128x128 ASM sparse kernel for arbitrary VSA rows. This is the primary
    exact compatibility path and must be benchmarked because reducing the query tile changes the
    eight-wave load/compute balance.
3. Optionally add a 256x128 union kernel carrying per-half membership bits if VSA masks have enough
    overlap to make union overcompute cheaper than the 128x128 kernel. This is a separate optimized
    ABI, not the default conversion.

A compatibility helper may decode existing VSA tensors into the common descriptor and reuse the
same packed executor. It must not create another quantization or dispatch stack. Ordered-prefix
optimizations such as `freeze_after` are optional manifest-selected extensions, not prerequisites
for compatibility.

## Output ABI Evolution

Existing kernels write BF16 through the v1 argument layout. Low-precision output requires a
versioned extension rather than repurposed fields, with explicit metadata for at least:

```text
output scale pointer
output data format
output scale format and mode
output scale strides or contiguous-layout metadata
```

Fix offsets with the first implementing kernel; existing v1 binaries retain their original size.

## `torch.compile` Rules

1. Keep Q, K, and V preprocessing as separate custom ops; keep ASM launch behind a custom op.
2. Pass exotic layouts across custom-op boundaries as contiguous raw buffers and rebuild views at
    launch. Fake implementations must expose exact public shapes and dtypes.
3. Version custom-op names whenever output shape, packed layout, or ABI changes.
4. Validate compiled paths with allocator churn and a downstream consumer.
5. Avoid data-dependent sparse allocations.
6. Use `Optional[T]`, not `T | None`, in public/fake/custom-op declarations because the latter
    caused a measured end-to-end Inductor regression.

## Forward Roadmap

1. Add sparse manifest rows, ragged-LUT validation, and exact 256x128/128x128 execution paths.
2. Add VSA/Sparge adapters over the shared sparse descriptor and packed executor.
3. Add LSE under a stable output schema for ring attention.
4. Add approximate BF16 under a distinct symbol and code object from generic v3 BF16.
5. Add a versioned low-precision-output ABI once data/scale ownership is concrete.
6. Expand architectures, head dimensions, sequence modes, and format combinations only through
    explicit manifest rows.

## Required Validation

Every dense change must preserve eager/fullgraph parity, finite output, allocator-churn safety,
explicit dispatch, unsupported-contract rejection, deterministic fixed-input behavior, and BF16
reference accuracy. Layout or quantizer changes additionally require byte-level tests at aligned
and ragged sequences. Synchronization or performance changes require repeated retained captures
and balanced multi-GPU target-shape benchmarking.

Sparse work adds LUT validation for partial KV tails, varied row counts, empty-row policy, explicit
sparse dispatch, and correctness against BF16. ABI or output-shape changes require versioned custom
ops and compatibility tests for existing binaries.
